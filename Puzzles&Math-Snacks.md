This is a list of my favourite puzzles and recreational math problems. I had
fun solving these so enjoy!

## Rainbow Prison

You are imprisoned along with 6 of your friends (7 people total). One night the
warden comes in and offers you to play the following game. 

In the morning one of the seven colors of the rainbow will be assigned to each of you
randomly(a colour might be shared by more than one person). The warden will
come in to each of you individually and will reveal the colours of all the
other inmates but not yours, then you have to guess your own colour. There is
no way any member of the group can hear your guess, communication is prohibited
once the game has started.

If any of you guesses their colour right you are rewarded with freedom and a
thousand playful puppies. If all of you fail you are punished by being made to
watch Ben Shapiro lectures eternally. Design a strategy that gives you the
puppies with absolute certainty.

## 100 Boxes and the Chosen One

You belong in an exclusive group of 100 people. To be honest, you are in
prison, but still an exclusive individual. Each one of you is assigned a unique number
from 1 to 100 known to the group. The prison warden is still up for torturing
you so they offer you to play the following game.

Tomorrow morning you will be presented with 100 boxes. Each of these boxes will
contain a piece of paper with a number from 1 to 100 written in it. Each number
will appear exactly once so the boxes contain a permutation of the numbers from
1 to 100. Before the game starts you can select a chosen member of the group
that can open all of the boxes and swap the contents of two boxes if he wants
to. After that you cannot communicate with this member at all.

Each of you must find their number. You take turns one after the other without
communicating. You can open at most 50 boxes. 

If all of you find your respective numbers you are rewarded with freedom and
people will be wholesome to each other forever. If you fail every baby born
will be subject to toxic propaganda. Please save the world and find a strategy
that will lead you to suceed with certainty 100% of the time.

## Equivalent Systems

Given two systems of linear inequalities: $Ax \leq b, Cx \leq d, x \in
\mathbb{R}^n$, where all the
entries of matrices $A, C$ and vectors $b,d$ are rational numbers, construct a
polynomial time algorithm to check if the two systems exhibit the same set of
solutions.

Specifically your algorithm should check whether: 

$\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t } Ax \leq b \} = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \text{ s.t } Cx \leq d \}$.
