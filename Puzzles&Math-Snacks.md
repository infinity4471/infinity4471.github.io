This is a list of my favourite puzzles and recreational math problems. I had
fun solving these so enjoy!

## Rainbow Prison

You are imprisoned along with 6 of your friends (7 people total). One night the
warden comes in and offers you to play the following game. 

In the morning one of the seven colors of the rainbow will be assigned to each of you
randomly(a colour might be shared by more than one person). The warden will
come in to each of you individually and will reveal the colours of all the
other inmates but not yours, then you have to guess your own colour.

If any of you guesses their colour right you are rewarded with freedom and a
thousand playful puppies. If all of you fail you are punished by being made to
watch Ben Shapiro lectures eternally. Design a strategy that gives you the
puppies with absolute certainty.
