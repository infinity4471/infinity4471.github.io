Hey there!

I'm Panagiotis, an undergraduate student of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens. At the moment I am
completing my Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis](www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on
the Dynamic Min Sum Set Cover Problem.

My scientific interests lie in the field of Theoretical Computer Science and Discrete
Mathematics. In particular I am interested in the theory of Algorithms, Data
Structures, Graph Theory, Data Science, Probability Theory and Combinatorics.

I am a former [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) intern where I worked on the
Financial Derivatives Pricing team developing a tool for pricing option
contracts using Quantum Computing. The theoretical backbone of our work can be
found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666).
