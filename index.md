Hey there!

I'm Panagiotis, I am currently an Intern Student Researcher at [Max Planck institute for informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home) working 
at the Algorithms and Complexity group supervised by [Dr. Themis Gouleakis](http://www.mit.edu/~tgoule/). Our research mainly focuses on Machine-Learning 
Augmented Algorithms for Robust Online Optimization.

In the past I completed my undergraduate studies in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the 
[National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en) where I did my Master Thesis under the supervision of 
[Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on the Dynamic Min Sum Set Cover Problem.

My scientific interests lie in the field of Theoretical Computer Science and Discrete
Mathematics. In particular I am interested in the theory of Algorithms, Data
Structures, Data Science, Financial Mathematics, Graph Theory and Combinatorics.

I'm a former [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) Software Engineer Intern where I worked on the
Financial Derivatives Pricing team developing a tool for pricing option
contracts using Quantum Computing. The theoretical backbone of our work can be
found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666).
