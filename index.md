Hey there!

I'm Panagiotis, I am an undergraduate student of Electrical and Computer
Engineering at the National Technical University of Athens. At the moment I am
completing my Master's Thesis under the supervision of Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis on
the Dynamic Min Sum Set Cover.

My intersts lie in the field of Theoretical Computer Science and Discrete
Mathematics. In particular I am interested in the theory of Algorithms, Data
Structures, Graph Theory, Probability Theory and Combinatorics.

In the past I have interned at Bloomberg LP in London where I worked on the
Financial Derivatives Pricing team developing a tool for pricing option
contracts using Quantum Computing.
