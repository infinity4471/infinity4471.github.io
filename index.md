Hey there!

I'm Panagiotis, a (incoming) Quantitative Researcher at [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/) based in Dublin, Ireland where I work in the Sports Trading and Analytics desk, developing proprietary strategies for Sports Betting.

I started my career as a Software Engineer. I'm a former [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) Software Engineer Intern where I worked in the Financial Derivatives Pricing team developing a tool for pricing exotic options using Quantum Computing. The theoretical backbone of our work can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666).

After that, I joined [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/eu/) as an Execution Software Engineer. My role mainly consisted of building and optimising our ultra low latency infrastructure for Order Sending and Market Data Processing for Options Market Making working primarily in C++. During my tenure there, I had the opportunity to work across various Options Market Making desks, including the European Index Options and the Crypto Options desk.

I've received my Integrated Master's in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en) where I did my Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on the [Approximability of Multistage Min-Sum Set Cover](https://github.com/infinity4471/Dynamic-Min-Sum-Set-Cover).

My scientific interests lie in the field of Theoretical Computer Science and Mathematics. In the past few years I've taken a keen interest in Financial Mathematics ranging from Probability Theory to Stochastic Calculus, Options Pricing, Volatility Models, Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning.
