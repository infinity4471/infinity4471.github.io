Hey there!

I'm Panos, a Quantitative Researcher at [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/) based in Dublin, Ireland where I work in the Sports Trading and Analytics desk, developing pre-game and in-game strategies for Sports Trading. Before making my transition to Quant Research I used to work at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/eu/) and [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com) as a Quantitative Developer.

At IMC, my role mainly consisted of building and optimising our ultra low latency infrastructure for Options Market Making working primarily in C++. During my tenure there, I had the opportunity to work across various trading desks, including the European Index Options and the Crypto Options desk.

I've received my Integrated Master's in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en) where I did my Master's Thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on the [Approximability of Multistage Min-Sum Set Cover](https://github.com/infinity4471/Dynamic-Min-Sum-Set-Cover).
