Hey there!

I'm Panagiotis, a Software Engineer at [IMC Trading](https://www.imc.com/eu/) based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

I've received my Integrated Master's in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the 
[National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en) where I did my Master's Thesis under the supervision of 
[Dr. Dimitrios Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/) on the [Approximability of Multistage Min-Sum Set Cover](https://github.com/infinity4471/Dynamic-Min-Sum-Set-Cover).

My scientific interests lie in the field of Theoretical Computer Science and
Mathematics. In particular I am interested in the theory of Algorithms, Data
Structures, Data Science and Financial Engineering.

I'm a former [Bloomberg LP](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/) Software Engineer Intern where I worked on the
Financial Derivatives Pricing team developing a tool for pricing option
contracts using Quantum Computing. The theoretical backbone of our work can be
found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666).
